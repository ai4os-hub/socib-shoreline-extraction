title: SOCIB Shoreline extraction
summary: A deployable AI module for shoreline extraction based on DeepLabV3
description: |-
  **The Balearic Islands Coastal Observing and Forecasting System** ([SOCIB](https://www.socib.es/)) operates a multi-platform system in the western Mediterranean to provide reliable data and expert advice.

  The **Shoreline position** is a key element in coastal research, engineering, and management. Its variability is driven by sea level and the continuous reshaping of the beach profile by incident waves, making it an integrated indicator of the coastal state and change. Due to the dynamic nature of the coastal environment, continuous monitoring of the shoreline is essential. This can be achieved using low-cost imaging systems and automated methods for shoreline extraction.

  The **SOCIB Shoreline extraction** module is an AI-driven application that automatically delineates the "instantaneous shoreline" (the dynamic waterline limit) from both oblique and rectified RGB images, excluding features like wet sand or vegetation. The extraction process is a two-step procedure: (i) the DeepLabV3 Convolutional Neural Network performs image segmentation into 'landward,' 'seaward,' and (for rectified images) 'background' classes; (ii) an automated post-processing step defines the shoreline as the boundary line separating the segmented 'landward' and 'seaward' areas. See examples below, where the top row displays the input images and the bottom row shows the output with the extracted shoreline:

  This application was trained using labelled oblique and rectified images from the [Spanish CoastSnap Network](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2024.107280), and delivers one different solution for each image type.
